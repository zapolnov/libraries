This is a set of cross-platform wrappers over the OpenGL ES 2.0 API.

Please note that OpenGL ES context creation and management is outside of the scope
of this library.

This library wraps all OpenGL types, constants, and functions into *GL*
and *gl* namespaces. For example, to call *glClear* function you may write the
following piece of code:

     gl::Clear(GL::COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL::DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

In debug builds, all calls to OpenGL functions are checked with *glError*
calls.

Currently, there are three wrappers available:

1. The **normal** wrapper is for use in all projects except for those built
   using the Qt library. On systems with OpenGL ES 2.0 support this wrapper
   invokes OpenGL ES functions directly. On desktop systems (Windows, Unix,
   OSX) OpenGL ES calls are implemented through the full version of OpenGL (with
   the help of the [OpenGL Extension Wrangler](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
   library).

2. The **qt** wrapper is intended for use in projects built with the
   [Qt library](http://qt-project.org/)). OpenGL calls are made through the
   [QGLFunctions](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qglfunctions.html) class.

3. At last, there is the **dummy** wrapper with all functions implemented as
   empty stubs. This wrapper is useful for compilation on platforms without
   OpenGL support and as a skeleton for new wrappers.

**Before usage, wrappers should be initialized by calling *gl::InitWrappers()*
function.**
